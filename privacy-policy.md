🔒 BLOXIT Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 01/11/25
App Name: BLOXIT
Contact: Contact.BloxIt@Gmail.com
⸻
1. Introduction
BLOXIT (“the App”) is a privacy-focused website blocker designed to help users limit access to chosen websites or categories (such as social media, gaming, or adult content).
We value your privacy and are committed to ensuring that no unnecessary personal data is collected, stored, or shared.
⸻
2. Information We Collect
BLOXIT does not collect or transmit any personal data to external servers.
All information stays locally on your device.
Specifically:
• Blocked websites, categories, and passwords are saved securely using Apple’s UserDefaults / App Group system on your device.
• No browsing history, traffic content, or analytics data are collected.
• We do not use cookies, tracking SDKs, or advertising identifiers.
⸻
3. VPN Usage
The VPN configuration used by BLOXIT is local and device-managed only.
It does not route your traffic through external servers.
Instead, it uses Apple’s Network Extension to block access to chosen domains locally on your device.
No browsing data, DNS queries, or connection details are logged or monitored by BLOXIT.
⸻
4. NextDNS Integration (if used)
If you enable integration with NextDNS, certain domain block lists may be synchronized using your own NextDNS profile ID.
BLOXIT itself does not view or store your NextDNS account data.
Any information processed by NextDNS is subject to their own NextDNS Privacy Policy￼.
⸻
5. Passwords & Security
• Passwords set within the app are stored locally and securely.
• We cannot access, recover, or view these passwords.
• For your security, uninstalling the app deletes all stored data permanently.
⸻
6. Data Sharing
We do not:
• Share or sell your data.
• Send information to third parties.
• Use analytics, advertising, or social plug-ins.
All data remains within your device’s storage sandbox or your private NextDNS account (if configured).
⸻
7. User Rights
Because BLOXIT does not collect or store identifiable information on any server, there is no data to access, correct, or delete externally.
To erase your data, simply uninstall the app from your device.
⸻
8. Children’s Privacy
BLOXIT can be used as a parental-control tool.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Parents or guardians maintain control of all password and blocking functions.
⸻
9. Updates to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes to the App or legal requirements.
The updated version will be available within the App Store listing and/or within the App itself.
